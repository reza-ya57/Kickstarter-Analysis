# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.
###   Analysis the history records of crowdfunding campaign to help Louise for running her fundraising campaing in best time and proper goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
## In this study I cassified the campaign outcomes based on their launch date and their funding goals. There was a chanlenge regarding to use the date info in this dataset and it was about the format of the dates which was based on unix timestamp. So before using date information I had to convert it into the readabl format. For more info about this conversion you can use this link: [Unix Timestamp Convertor] (https://www.epochconverter.com/) 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
