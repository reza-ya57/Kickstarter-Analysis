# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.
###   Analysis the crowdfunding campaigns information in period of 2010 to 2017 to help Louise for running her fundraising campaign with the high confidence in the best time and with the proper defined goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
## In this study I classified the campaign outcomes based on their launch date and their funding goals, in order to find a meaningfull relation between the launch time and goals and succeeded. Louise want to run a campaign for theater category so in this analysis I just focused on this category to analyse the data. 



There was a challenge for using the date info in this dataset because of the format of the dates which was based on unix timestamp. So before using date information I had to convert it into the readable format. Check [Unix Timestamp Convertor](https://www.epochconverter.com) for more detail information.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  - In below graph you can see the trend of outcomes in monthly manner. The grapgh shows the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for theater in different month of the year.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
